# Team Ultrarunning-Insights Peer Feedback
### Ethan Pedersen & Jackson Dean

We spoke with Nishita Kharche, Nick Lord-Ender-Laing, & Eisen Montalvo. They gave us a lot of great feedback and helped us think about different aspects of our project in a new light.
They had a lot of suggested ideas for ways we could visualize data as well, like using color encodings for field size and adding line chart animations to simulate running. 

One question they asked which we hadn’t thought a lot about was the tone of our project and the intended audience. Obviously, we want to provide information to people interested in ultra distance running, but upon reflection we realize that our tone needs to be casual and fun to make it enticing for people to learn about a niche topic. 

One idea that kept coming up was the idea of a ‘centerpiece’ visualization, and what ours is. We will continue to not focus on one centerpiece, but to have one main visualization for each tab on our dashboard. This puts each tab on equal levels. 

They came up with an idea that we had also come up with and discarded in the proposal process - they asked what if we used a horizontal scrolling layout to match the idea of a runner going across. Although it is a fun idea and adds some ‘wow’ factor, we don’t think it will be effective and exploring our dataset. If we had more of a detailed story to share, this would make more sense, but we think it will be better off if it is easier to explore on your own. 

The team gave us great feedback, and we thought the peer review session was worth it. It both validated and challenged some of our design decisions.
